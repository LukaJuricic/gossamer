# Gossamer

## A personal journey into robotics

Gossamer is a personal project for the creation of a smart hexapod robot, Artie.
It contains a guide on how to create Artie from scratch and program it.

The main objective is to have fun and deepen my knowledge of robotics, in all its multi-faceted aspects: mechanics, manufacturing, electronics, motion control, computer vision, navigation, etc...

For this reason it is presented not only how Artie is made, but also the whole process that led to this particular design, from the initial problem definition, to the research of the possible solutions, to the final choice.
Creating such documentation would help me understand better the subjects, and would make it easier for others to take different choices and create their own variant.

## Current status

Just started!
Researching currently available hexapod robots, preferably open-sourced, to get a feeling of the possible general designs.
